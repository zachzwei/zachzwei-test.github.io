# `Node and RPC Provider setup for LavaNet`

## Proceed at your own risk.
`The following guides have been simplified and tested to work on a dedicated server running Ubuntu 22.04. Credit goes to the hard-working developers of the following chains. 
I merely copied and compiled these guide for personal use. 
I have no programming background. 
Hopefully it helps you to get started with setting up your own node. Cheers!`
